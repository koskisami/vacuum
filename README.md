# vacuum
vacuum is an application that i made for myself to try and make the experience of downloading youtube videos as painless and seamless as possible for me.

the basic idea is to have vacuum running in the background while looking for videos to download, and then when i find one i copy the link, and vacuum automatically tries to download the video at highest quality, in a format that Adobe Premiere can understand.

this app was built partially using GPT to see how I possibly could integrate LLM's to my workflow.

## how to build it?
⚠️ since this is my own hobby project I will not be providing any kind of support.

- **TODO** Add build instructions
